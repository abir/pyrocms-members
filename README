This is a single-use directory of contacts for pyrocms.  

the included fields will probably not suit 
many people but it is a common request I 
get from my clients to have a list of contacts
posted on their site that is easy to manage.  

So this is a starting place that applies for most 
and you can add fields pretty easy by simply changing 
the following four things: 

1) database table (can be done preinstall from details.php, or in the table itself)
2) form_validation rules in admin controller's constructor (controllers/admin.php)
3) form view (views/admin/form.php)
4) front-end view (views/index.php)

good luck, hope this saves someone some time.
